	<h1>This is a header.</h1>

	<p>This is a simple paragraph for the Day One Page. It's short and to the point.</p>

	<h2>This is another smaller header.</h2>

	<p>This is another simple little paragraph. It's a little longer than the first, but not by much.</p>
	<p>This is the last paragraph of the Day One Page. After this it will only be more header tags to demonstrate the other header sizes, and a few pointless lists.</p>

	<ul>This is an unordered list.
		<li>This is just an item in the list.</li>

			<ol>There are three items in it listed by importance
				<li>This is the first.</li>
				<li>This is the second.</li>
				<li>This is the third and final. Its a list within a list. Listception.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ul>

	<h4>This is the fourth.</h4>

	<ol>This is an ordered list.
		<li>This is the first item.</li>
